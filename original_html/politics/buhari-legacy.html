      <p class="mb-4">
        After the Biafran war, no president or head of state accepted to pay ex Biafran soldiers. They were considered enemies of the nation.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        One evening, Buhari called his Minister of Defence and instructed him to commence the process of changing the lives of those who fought for Biafra.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        He knew they fought for what they believed in—survival, and self-determination.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        It was Buhari who had the courage to pardon them. Obasanjo refused to do it. Yaradua wanted to but died. Jonathan didn’t want to be seen as a pro-Biafran president and ignored their plight.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        But Buhari governed by conviction. He granted them pardon, apologized, and paid them millions—not even for political gain.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Remember when I showed historical evidence that South Africa supported Biafra and not Nigeria? That’s why many Igbos live in South Africa today—SA opened its borders and offered assistance.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        How many remember my teachings on PLURALITY? No human is entirely good or bad. A balanced view sees the good in even those we dislike.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        I’m running this series because in 2027, many will attack Peter Obi and focus only on negatives. If you’ve never said anything positive about someone you hate, you may be deeply biased.
