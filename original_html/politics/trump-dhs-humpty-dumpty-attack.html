        <p class="mb-4">
          In an unusually sharp rebuke, officials from former President <strong>Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS)</strong> targeted a key adviser in the Biden administration this week—mockingly referring to him as “Humpty Dumpty.”
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          The jibe, posted on social media and echoed by right-leaning commentators, accused the adviser of distorting facts in recent remarks related to national security and immigration policies. “When Humpty Dumpty speaks, he expects words to mean whatever he wants,” read a post from a verified DHS account affiliated with Trump-era officials.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          The comment appears to be a direct attack on <strong>Jake Sullivan</strong>, Biden's National Security Adviser, following his televised remarks defending the administration’s border strategy and counterterrorism record.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Political analysts say the post marks a new escalation in rhetoric between former Trump officials and the current White House, further polarizing an already divided political climate ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
        </p>

        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-emerald-400 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 mb-6">
          “This is more than a childish nickname—it’s a calculated attempt to delegitimize national security leadership,” said a Georgetown professor of political communication.
        </blockquote>

        <p class="mb-4">
          The Biden administration has not officially responded to the remark, although sources close to the White House labeled the comment “undignified and unserious.”
