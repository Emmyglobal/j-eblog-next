    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      Justice James Omotosho of a Federal High Court in Abuja will on <strong>October 10</strong> determine whether the Federal Government has proven enough terrorism allegations against Nnamdi Kanu to require him to open a defence.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      The decision follows the conclusion of arguments on Kanu’s no-case submission, where his legal team, led by Chief Kanu Agabi (SAN), claimed the prosecution failed to provide evidence of terrorism or incitement.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      Agabi argued that the five DSS witnesses never linked Kanu to any acts of violence, and that no investigation was submitted to support the claims. He noted that boasting about defending oneself is not terrorism, citing constitutional rights.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      The prosecution, led by Chief Adegboyega Awomolo (SAN), countered that Kanu’s broadcasts incited violence, caused fear, and led to attacks on police officers. He insisted that Kanu's words were actionable threats, not mere rhetoric.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      Justice Omotosho, after listening to both parties, fixed <strong>October 10</strong> for ruling on the no-case submission. Kanu was previously re-arraigned on a seven-count charge after the case was reassigned due to bias allegations against Justice Binta Nyako.
