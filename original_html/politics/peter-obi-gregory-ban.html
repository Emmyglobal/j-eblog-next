          The Edo State Governor, Monday Okpebholo, has banned the presidential candidate of the Labour Party in the 2023 elections, Peter Obi, from entering the state without security clearance.
          This comes after three individuals allegedly lost their lives during Obi’s last visit to Edo State.
        </p>

        <p>
          The announcement was made as Hon. Marcus Onobun, the last federal lawmaker elected under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo, officially defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC).
        </p>

        <p>
          During the defection event, Governor Okpebholo described the move as the “final nail in the coffin of PDP” and emphasized that the APC now has full control over the political landscape in Edo State.
        </p>

        <p>
          "We are not lobbying anyone to join APC. They are coming because they see the results of our governance," the governor declared. He added that by the 2027 general elections, 2.5 million votes from Edo State would be guaranteed for President Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
        </p>

        <p>
          The governor also took a swipe at opposition parties, especially Labour Party, saying popularity on social media means nothing if not backed by real performance and governance.
