        <p class="mb-4">
          Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) has confirmed the elimination of two Russian Federal Security Service (FSB)
          agents suspected of assassinating <strong>Colonel Ivan Voronych</strong>, a senior officer of the SBU’s Special Operations Centre.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          The operation occurred just days after <strong>Voronych was gunned down in Kyiv</strong> on July 10. Surveillance footage showed
          the suspects trailing the colonel before ambushing him with a silenced pistol in the Holosiivskyi district.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          SBU chief <strong>Vasyl Malyuk</strong> stated that the two FSB agents—one male and one female—entered Ukraine several days prior
          to the killing. They retrieved the murder weapon from a hidden arms cache before carrying out the assassination at around 9 a.m.
        </p>

        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-emerald-400 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 mb-6">
          “The SBU eliminated the killers who killed the Security Service colonel in Kyiv,” read a statement from the Ukrainian
          government’s Telegram channel.
        </blockquote>

        <p class="mb-4">
          A <strong>special operation was launched in Kyiv Oblast</strong> to find the suspects. Upon locating them, the agents reportedly
          resisted arrest, leading to a shootout in which both were killed. The SBU emphasized that the mission was led personally by
          Lieutenant General Malyuk.

        />

        <p class="mb-4">
          The Ukrainian Office of the Prosecutor General oversaw the legal and procedural elements of the operation, ensuring full
          accountability.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Malyuk praised the <strong>Ukrainian National Police</strong> for their role in the operation, highlighting that counterintelligence
          and the neutralization of Russian special operations groups remain a top priority.
