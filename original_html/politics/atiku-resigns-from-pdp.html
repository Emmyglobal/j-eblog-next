      <p class="mb-4">Atiku Abubakar, former Nigerian Vice President, has officially resigned from the People's Democratic Party (PDP). His letter dated July 14, 2025, was posted by Dele Momodu and addressed to the PDP Chairman, Jada 1 Ward, Jada LGA, Adamawa State.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">In the letter, Atiku wrote:</p>
      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic mb-4">
        "I am writing to formally resign my membership from the People's Democratic Party (PDP) with immediate effect. I am grateful for the opportunities given to me, including serving two full terms as Vice President and being the Party's Presidential candidate twice. However, the Party’s current trajectory diverges from our founding principles. It is with a heavy heart that I make this decision."
      </blockquote>

      <p class="mb-4">Atiku further expressed appreciation to the party and wished its leadership well. He emphasized that his decision was due to irreconcilable differences with the current direction of the party.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Atiku is now part of a new coalition under the African Democratic Congress (ADC) alongside political figures such as Peter Obi, Nasir El-Rufai, David Mark, Rotimi Amaechi, and Rauf Aregbesola, positioning themselves as a “better option” for Nigerians ahead of the 2027 general elections.</p>
