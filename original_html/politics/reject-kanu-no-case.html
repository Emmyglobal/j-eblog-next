      The Federal Government on Friday asked the Federal High Court in Abuja to dismiss the no-case submission filed by the detained leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      According to the lead counsel for the FG, Adegboyega Awomolo, SAN, Kanu had made inflammatory broadcasts on Radio Biafra where he declared his intention to break Nigeria and form a Biafran republic. Awomolo argued that the defendant's broadcasts incited fear and encouraged violence, particularly targeting police officers and their families.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      “He did not just issue threats, he gave orders to his followers to kill police officers. Shortly after, over 170 security personnel were killed,” Awomolo emphasized. He stressed that the broadcasts were more than rhetoric; they were calculated incitements that have endangered national security.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      The prosecution insisted that Kanu's public self-identification as IPOB leader after its proscription was evidence of defiance and illegal operation. They argued that the law forbids inciting comments and that Kanu’s actions should have consequences under Nigeria’s anti-terrorism laws.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      Awomolo urged Justice James Omotosho to compel the IPOB leader to open his defence, describing his no-case submission as “misplaced and misconceived.” He maintained that Kanu has a case to answer in relation to the seven-count terrorism charge against him.
