                    <p class="mb-4">If Jubril successfully impersonated Buhari without the global intelligence community knowing, then the BUHARI who you claim died in 2017 & Jubril who died yesterday were the most intelligent humans to walk the earth.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">They were smarter than the USA 🇺🇸, Russia 🇷🇺, UK 🇬🇧, Israel 🇮🇱, China 🇨🇳 and the entire Security Intelligence community in the world. I will personally desire that level of intelligence and global connections myself.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Some of you don’t know anything about <strong>IMINT - imagery intelligence</strong>. As we speak, through IMINT, Trump told Iran 🇮🇷 the location of their leader. The closest people around me understand my company’s technologies deployed in security communities. So I understand IMINT and thus know that it’s scientifically impossible for a Buhari to die and a Jubril would takeover and shake hands with global leaders as president of Nigeria—otherwise the Iran leader could have become Musa and live freely.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">If you believed such, I do not blame you. Buhari also called IPOB “a dot in a circle”. Note, he didn’t call IGBOS a Dot in a circle. He was responding to a question specifically about IPOB. So IPOB leaders can be justified when they held him by his scrotum by formulating the now viral conspiracy theory about his identity.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>That was the most intelligent propaganda ever executed by any proscribed group against a sitting president.</strong></p>

                    <p class="mb-4">You can’t argue that <strong>Nnamdi Kanu</strong> is the most sophisticated strategist Nigeria has ever seen and he demonstrated that with the Jubril conspiracy theory. Nnamdi didn’t need guns to hurt any government, he used the power of his mind to control millions of minds. In my list of masterminds, Nnamdi Kanu has a place. But unfortunately, none of the people who believed the story have 1% of Nnamdi’s intelligence.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">That’s why you need to be an <strong>INTELLIGENT FOLLOWER</strong>. Know when your leader is deploying a master strategic propaganda machine to save your brain from abuse.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">IPOB supporters who are masterminds told me in those days that they never believed the story. We laughed at how easy it is for our people to believe anything said against anyone we don’t like.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Even IPOB leaders called Buhari “olodo” and <strong>CLUELESS</strong> — I think neither Buhari nor his entire Government had the sophistication to execute a Jubril takeover without “America knowing about it” - <em>credit: GEJ</em></p>

                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>You get it? If you don’t get it, the post is beyond your intellectual capacity. But if you get it, you are a mastermind too.</strong></p>

                    <p class="mb-4">The assets of former Nigerian President <strong>Muhammadu Buhari</strong> have been publicly disclosed following his passing on <strong>July 13, 2025</strong>, in London after a prolonged illness.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">This revelation comes as the nation continues to mourn the military general and two-time leader. The declaration provides a rare glimpse into his personal estate, further sparking discussions across political and social circles.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Here are the key highlights of President Buhari’s declared assets:</strong></p>

                    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Five properties:</strong> Located in <em>Kaduna</em>, <em>Daura</em>, <em>Kano</em>, and <em>Abuja</em>, including two mud houses.</li>
                        <li><strong>Agricultural holdings:</strong> Large farms, an orchard, and a ranch housing:
                            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                                <li>270 heads of cattle</li>
                                <li>25 sheep</li>
                                <li>5 horses</li>
                                <li>Various birds</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Land ownership:</strong> Two undeveloped plots of land.</li>
                        <li><strong>Financial assets:</strong> Approximately <strong>$150,000</strong> in personal bank savings and <strong>₦30 million</strong> in a Union Bank account.</li>
                        <li><strong>Equity investments:</strong> Shares in Berger Paints, Union Bank, and Skye Bank.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="mb-4">While his critics often scrutinized his austere lifestyle, this declaration paints a picture of a leader who lived modestly yet maintained extensive agricultural and rural assets reflective of his background and values.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">The disclosure adds a new dimension to the national conversation on leadership, wealth, and transparency.</p>

            Ufuoma Bernard made a viral claim—and many Nigerians silently nodded. Nigerian politics, he said, is not for gentlemen. It’s a ruthless arena where thugs rise faster than thinkers, and promises are broken even before they are made.

            But is it true that no clean hands survive in Nigerian governance? What kind of system rewards dishonesty and punishes principles?

                        <li>Historic democratic breakthrough: unseating an incumbent in 2015.</li>
                        <li>Symbolism of integrity: a champion against corruption, though with limited success.</li>
                        <li>Mixed governance: infrastructure gains offset by economic downturn and insecurity.</li>
                        <li>Authoritarian controversies: forceful responses to protests and media restrictions.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <span class="block mb-2">Governor Alex Chioma Otti hails from Umuehim Village, Ehi na Uguru Ancient Kingdom in Isialangwa South Local Government Area of Abia State.</span>
                    <span class="block mb-2">Born on February 18, 1965, to Pastor and Mrs. Lazarus Weze Otti, he attended Ngwa High School, Abayi Aba, and Secondary Technical School, Okpuala Ngwa, both in Abia State.</span>
                    <span class="block mb-2">Otti recorded the best result in his school's certificate examination for his set and graduated from the University of Port Harcourt in 1988 with First Class Honours in Economics.</span>
                    <span class="block mb-2">He began his banking career in 1989 at Nigerian International Bank (Citibank), then moved to Nigerian Intercontinental Merchant Bank LTD, and later joined Societe Bancaire Nigeria Limited (Banque SBA, Paris) as Senior Manager in 1992.</span>
                    <span class="block mb-2">While working, he earned an MBA from the University of Lagos in 1994 and attended international courses in Columbia and the United States (Pennsylvania), as well as an executive programme at INSEAD, Fountainebleau, France.</span>
                    <span class="block mb-2">Otti later joined UBA as Principal Manager, growing the bank's oil and gas business. In May 2001, he joined First Bank of Nigeria Plc as Assistant General Manager for the energy sector, holding several executive positions including Deputy General Manager, Executive Director Commercial Banking, and Executive Director, South Directorate.</span>
                    <span class="block mb-2">In March 2011, he became Group Managing Director/CEO of Diamond Bank, with his tenure renewed in 2014 for his significant impact. The Chairman of Diamond Bank, Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Achebe, described Otti's years as the brightest in the bank's history.</span>
                    <span class="block mb-2">Otti retired from banking in October 2014 and entered politics with APGA, contesting for Abia State Governor in 2015 and 2019. Despite setbacks, his third attempt in 2023 on the Labour Party platform was successful, and he was sworn in as Governor.</span>
