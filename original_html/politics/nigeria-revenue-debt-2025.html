    <section class="space-y-6 leading-relaxed">

      <p>
        Mr. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwo_Oyedele" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-emerald-600 underline">Taiwo Oyedele</a>, Chairman of the Presidential Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms Committee, revealed at the PwC Tax Reform Summit in Lagos that Nigeria’s fiscal indicators have markedly improved. 
        While debt servicing once consumed nearly 97% of federal revenue, it has now dropped below 50% after aggressive fiscal reforms :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
      </p>

      <p>
        Key highlights include:
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
          <li>Cleared over $7 billion in forex futures and increased foreign reserves from under $4 billion to over $20 billion</li>
          <li>Tax-to-GDP ratio rose from under 10% to 13.5% in just two years</li>
          <li>Budget deficits declined, and government stopped printing indiscriminate naira</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Oyedele warned that without reforms, Nigeria risked hyperinflation and collapse similar to Zimbabwe and Venezuela :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. He painted a vivid picture using the example of a ₦100 trillion Zimbabwean note being worthless for buying bread.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite progress, public debt continues to soar. A Nairametrics study showed Nigeria’s debt rose over 1,000% in naira terms (from N12.6 trillion in 2015 to N144 trillion in 2024) and by 44% in USD terms ($65 billion to $94 billion) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. Currency depreciation means servicing foreign-denominated debt is increasingly expensive.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Guardian describes public debt at ₦144.7 trillion, with debt-to-revenue ratio around 64% in 2025 :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. PwC warned debt servicing could reach ₦9.3 trillion in 2025 and argued that 37% debt-to-GDP is manageable—only if borrowing targets productive investments and not recurrent expenses :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reasons behind rising debt include:
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
          <li>Persistent deficits financed through bond issuance and Ways & Means</li>
          <li>Low revenue collection and weak tax-to-GDP ratios</li>
          <li>Currency devaluation inflating foreign debt costs</li>
          <li>Heavy external borrowing—nearly 49% is foreign debt</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        The Debt Management Office (DMO), established in 2000, oversees government borrowing and debt policy :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}. Meanwhile, the National Assembly’s <em>House Committee on Aids, Loans and Debt Management</em> carries out legislative oversight over new loans :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.
      </p>

      <p>
        Analysts emphasize that sustaining progress will hinge on improved revenue mobilization, disciplined policy, and using borrowed funds for infrastructure rather than consumption. As of early 2025, the government planned an ambitious $21.5 billion foreign borrowing strategy, raising further concerns :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.
