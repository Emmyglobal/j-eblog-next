    <p class="mb-4">Dr. Olabode Abimbola Ibikunle, a senior lecturer known for his strict disciplinary approach at Kogi State University (KSU), has reportedly died in a hotel room under mysterious circumstances.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Reports allege that Dr. Ibikunle checked into a local hotel in Anyigba with a 200-level student from the Department of Social Studies Education. Eyewitnesses say the student, described as “beautiful” and “Ebira,” accompanied him without resistance.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Sources close to the scene claim that Dr. Ibikunle consumed multiple energy drinks prior to the encounter, seemingly preparing for an intense physical activity. The first round reportedly concluded without incident, but he collapsed as the second round was about to begin.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">The lady raised the alarm, and hotel staff rushed in. Dr. Ibikunle was pronounced dead at the scene. The young lady is now in police custody, and authorities suspect possible poisoning, although investigations are ongoing.</p>

    <p class="mt-4">While the university community remains in shock, some students are reportedly celebrating the death of the lecturer, who was infamous for his no-nonsense grading style and classroom policies.</p>
