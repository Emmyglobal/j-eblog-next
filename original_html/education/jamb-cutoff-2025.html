      <p class="mb-4">JAMB has pegged <strong>150</strong> as a cut-off mark for admission into universities. The board also fixed <strong>100</strong> as the minimum cut-off point mark for admission into polytechnics and colleges of education, while admission into Colleges of Nursing Sciences was fixed at <strong>140</strong>.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">JAMB Registrar, Professor Ishaq Oloyede announced this on Tuesday in Abuja at the 2025 JAMB Policy meeting.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Candidates are to note that the cut-off marks above are the JAMB <strong>minimum</strong> cut-off marks. This means institutions are free to set their own cut-off marks above the minimum but not below.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">The meeting had in attendance the Minister of Education, Tunji Alaussa, vice-chancellors, rectors, registrars of higher institutions, and other key stakeholders.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">During the meeting, it was also re-emphasised that the admissible age to tertiary institutions in Nigeria remains <strong>16 years</strong>.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">With the announcement of the cutoff marks, most public tertiary institutions will commence sales of Post-UTME screening forms in earnest. Candidates are advised to stay alert for announcements and updates from their institutions of choice.</p>
